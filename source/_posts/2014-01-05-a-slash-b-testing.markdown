A/B Testing is pretty much required these days and it needs to be a fundamental features that you don't ever think about like logging caching or security. You may have to think about it, but it shouldn't be hard such that you don't do it.

Why is it pretty much required? Software complexity is exploding to meet ever rising expectations.

People have never had trouble dreaming up how technology should be awesome. Think Star Trek or Back to the Future. The problem is that smart phones have become pretty amazing and companies like Google and Facebook have done amazing things on a staggering scale that the gap between sci-fi and reality is blurred for most normals.

I chuckle when my six year old son waves his hand in front of a _manual_ paper towel dispenser after washing his hands in the men's restroom. Answers to questions like where do babies come from are possibly less complicated to answer than explaining the subtle differences between tivo, netflix, amazon instant video, itunes and appreciating live tv vs dvds, streaming and downloaded. He doesn't really care, he just wants to watch an episode of attack of the clones and doesn't understand why he has to wait until 9:30 AM on Saturday.
