  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently read the book <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders at Work</a> on <a href="http://blargh.tommymontgomery.com/">tmont’s</a> recommendation. It was a good read, and at 500+ pages you can repurpose it as a monitor stand when you’re finished reading it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Based on nearly eighty hours of conversations with fifteen all-time great programmers and computer scientists, the Q&amp;A interviews in Coders at Work provide a multifaceted view into how great programmers learn to program, how they practice their craft, and what they think about the future of programming.</p></blockquote>

<p>The author, Peter Siebel, asked each of the interviewees “Do you consider yourself a hacker, artist, craftsman or engineer?” It’s a good question and one I forgot about until <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/09/hacker-novice-artist-and-craftsman.html">Uncle Bob wrote an article</a> suggesting a correlation with one’s definition of done. It’s a clever angle but there is more to explore.</p>

<h2>Hacker</h2>

<p>On a PDP-8 with only eight instructions and two registers, you’re going to need some ingenuity, maybe even the rare kind of intellect that led a 14 year-old to win eight United States Chess Championships in a row.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s just you and your opponent at the board and you’re trying to prove something. — Bobby Fischer</p></blockquote>

<p>The hacker lives in a world of tight constraints, like Houdini in a straight jacket inside a locked box submerged in icy water. The hacker gets a thrill from this kind of challenge and often relies on a toolbox of algorithms and decompilers to get the job done. The hacker isn’t satisfied with mainstream abstractions for IO, instead the hacker knows exactly what happens when you write a file or open a socket and why you might choose UDP instead of TCP. The hacker is the guy that’s going to push the industry forward with new technology and techniques.</p>

<p>It’s a fine line though, finding loopholes and circumventing the intent of your framework can be a recipe for disaster. Often times, it’s not just you and the machine, it’s you and a team of developers writing software for users that expect their cell phone to stream music from Pandora via Bluetooth to their car stereo while rendering a map of the current location with real-time traffic info. And if all this takes a few extra seconds, your software is casually dismissed as a piece of crap.</p>

<h2>Artist</h2>

<p>The artist believes that software is an expression of one’s self. The process is creative and each solution is subtly unique like a brush stroke on a canvas. An artist believes what they do is special and you could no more teach someone how to be a great programmer than you could teach someone how to write a great song or novel. You’ve either got it or you don’t.</p>

<p>Just like a great band, truly great software comes from a small team with just the right mix of strengths and styles. Too many contributors and it’s a mess. Not enough and it’s too predictable. Boston was a great band, but it was dominated by Tom Schulz, the guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter and producer. He owned every note. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, Boston sold over 31 million albums in the United States. But consider the Beatles, two creative forces pushing and pulling on each other, clashing and meshing to produce a truly dynamic catalog.</p>

<h2>Craftsman</h2>

<p>If you’re having open heart surgery, you probably want an experienced doctor holding the scalpel. The human body is a complex system and reading a text book just isn’t the same as years of experience.</p>

<p>Programming is difficult. At its core, it is about managing complexity. Computer programs are the most complex things that humans make. Quality is illusive and elusive. – Douglas Crockford</p>

<p>When a fine furniture craftsman looks at a piece of wood, the unique shape and the location of the knots are thoughtfully considered. The craftsman observes how dry or green the wood is, how hard or soft it is and applies a set of best practices honed through years of experience to produce the finest end result.</p>

<p>The craftsman believes that most software problems are the same but knows a solution can’t be stamped out by code monkeys. Physical and financial constraints, subtleties of the problem domain and quirks of a particular framework or language require an experienced and steady hand to produce a quality product. The craftsman believes software development is a highly skilled trade and to become an expert you must start as an apprentice.</p>

<h2>Engineer</h2>

<p>An engineer writes the kind of software you count on when you drive a car, fly in a plane or dial 911; Where a failure means more than a delayed shipment or double payment on your online order. The stakes are high and the problems are too big to fit in one person’s head. Problems that only process and frameworks can wrangle. You can’t simply start typing and watch the design of your application emerge from nothing, it requires detailed analysis and thoughtful study.</p>

<p>Which one am I? I have a piece of paper that says Engineer on it, and while I enjoy writing frameworks as much as the next guy, I’m a craftsman. Maybe it’s because I’ve been doing this for a dozen years and I’d like to think my experience is worth more than a piece of paper.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, if you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will. I got spare time. But for now, for your customer’s sake, for your daughter’s sake, ya might wanna think about buying a quality product from me. – Tommy Boy</p></blockquote>

<p>Which one are you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in junior high around the time that Master of Puppets was released followed by <em>…And Justice For All</em>. Maybe it’s nostalgia, but those two albums were not only the best Metallica albums, they were perhaps the greatest albums of the entire genre. Something happened though and I don’t mean grunge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/grunge_thumb.jpg"></p>

<p>Metallica eventually succumbed to their own success and tried to crank out albums more accessible to wider audiences. This tension between music with something to say and music that appeals to the masses has been the bane of the industry since the invention of the radio.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, go ask 10 people what their favorite Metallica song is. You’re going to hear Enter Sandman unless you work at an auto shop or maybe guitar center in which case you’re probably not reading this article. You’re going to hear Enter Sandman because that song was engineered by producers and marketing types to be played on the same radio stations that host morning shows like Jeff and Jer, yet that song couldn’t be further from the band’s roots.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you ask 10 programmers if they use design patterns, you will undoubtedly hear a resounding yes citing the widely accessible singleton pattern. Why is this the case? It’s because the singleton most closely resembles something that looks familiar when writing procedural code and it’s the easiest pattern to insert into a pile of crap. The problem is that the singleton represents design patterns about as well as Enter Sandman captures the essence of why Metallica was a great band.</p>

<p>Pattern catalogs should probably look more like this:</p>

<p><strong>Design Patterns:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Singleton*</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Decorator</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>


<p><em>* Not a design pattern</em></p>

<p>Or at least come with a warning label.</p>

<blockquote><p>Warning: The Singleton is actually a global variable. Use this pattern as a last resort and be sure to hide the fact you are using it from the rest of your application and your manager.</p></blockquote>

<p>So how do you know if you’re using the Singleton correctly? I’ll give you a hint, if you have any knowledge of the fact that the object you’re using is a singleton, then you’re not using it correctly. Let’s say you’re writing some caching logic since it’s one of those places where singletons pop up.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simple interface for finding a user object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">interface</span> <span class="n">IUserRepository</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">User</span> <span class="nf">FindById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You realize you keep doing the same lookup over and over and adding some caching would really perk up the application. Hooray, for the Singleton!</p>

<p>Well this probably works great in a console application or Windows service, but what if your code is running in a web application, or as a WCF service. What if your Windows service is distributed across multiple machines? Should you care how your application is deployed in your <code>CachingUserRepository</code>? No, you shouldn’t. That object has one responsibility, and it’s to manage collaboration with the cache. Let’s try this instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Maybe your cache should live for the lifetime of a single web request, or maybe a web session, or possibly a distributed cache is right for your scenario. The good news is that caching is one of those solved problems, like data access, so you can just pick your favorite library and plug it in to your application with a simple adapter:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="n">HttpRequestCacheProvider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">HttpSessionCacheProvider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">HttpContextCacheProvider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">MemcacheCacheProvider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">EnterpriseLibraryCacheProvider</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">VelocityCacheProvider</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let’s say you still want to roll your own cache and you decide that singleton is right scope for you. That’s okay, just recognize that using a singleton is a configuration decision and should not leak out into your application. The only place that you should see that .Instance getter is where you bootstrap your application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I’ve been wrapping up interviews with the question “What makes software maintainable?” I usually catch a glimpse that says “hmm… I’ve never really thought about maintainability” followed by a response to the question “What makes software good?”, which I didn’t actually ask, but most programmers have thought enough about to give an on the spot answer. The bland responses inevitably involve documentation (fail) and maybe something about consistency (meh).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/trump_thumb.jpg"></p>

<p>The underlying question I’m asking is a question you should ask yourself every time you write a line of line of code. That question is “What are you optimizing?” Most programmers have mentally hard-coded the term optimize to mean efficient use of memory and cpu, however it’s a horribly myopic definition. In fact, it’s just plain wrong unless you’re writing an iPhone game or maybe you work at Google and saving a few cpu cycles translates to kilowatts of power and possibly saving a small rain forest.</p>

<p>Let’s see what Wikipedia has to say.</p>

<blockquote><p>In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources.[1] In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power. — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_</a>(computer_science)</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/posts/conserve_thumb1.jpg"></p>

<p>It’s not wrong, but it reinforces the notion that less is more and the precious resources are physical resources like memory and cpu. Is it better to have fewer files in your project, fewer dlls in your bin directory, or use fewer semicolons? I recently debugged a chain of jQuery statements that was 430 characters long (un-minified) and used one semicolon. Is that optimized?</p>

<p>Consider this definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>In mathematics, computer science and economics, optimization, or mathematical programming, refers to choosing the best element from some set of available alternatives. — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_</a>(mathematics)</p></blockquote>

<p>This does a better job of capturing the trade-offs we make on a daily basis. I like the idea of choosing the best element rather than consuming the fewest resources. Instead of asking what you’re optimizing, a better question might be what are you maximizing? For a new iPhone game, maybe time to market is your number one concern. I work on enterprise SaaS applications that have a long shelf life so maintainability is a pretty big deal. I strive to maximize readability and testability when I write software. What are you maximizing?</p>

<p>There isn’t much going on here, but it could be better. I’m looking at the arguments <code>pageSize</code> and <code>pageNumber</code>. Notice how they both start with the prefix “page”. That’s a smell. The common prefix means the arguments are related, so let’s apply the <em>Introduce Parameter Object</em> refactoring and see what happens.</p>

<p>What did we accomplish?</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating the parameter object gave us a place to put the logic of calculating the first result of the current page. This logic would otherwise be scattered around the application and even though it’s simple, it’s error prone.</li>
<li>The logic of calculating the first result is testable.</li>

<p>It’s not rocket science, but it still deserves a test. Our other option is spinning up Cassini and clicking around to make sure we got it right. That’s just silly. A little piece of me dies each time I press F5 to run a manual test.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is this thing that happens with single responsibility classes. Because their purpose is crisp, it draws out robustness. In this case, I’m thinking about what we should we do if we get zero or a negative value for page number. I’m a fail fast kind of guy, so I’d probably go with a guard clause.</p>

<p>The point is that this is an obvious scenario to consider when looking at such a special purpose object. All too often though, bits of logic are mixed together like 32 kindergarteners sitting next to each other on a rug during a lesson. The room is one fart or tickle away from erupting into total kaos. It’s roughly half teaching and half crowd control, only without the rubber bullets and pepper spray. Not surprisingly, overcrowded classrooms don’t work that well and over-ambitous functions don’t work that well either. Each little bit of logic needs some one on one with you. Give it a chance to be all it can be by pulling it aside and getting to know it a little better. You might be surprised.</p>

<p>I recently saw this question on stackoverflow:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/quest.png"></p>

<p>There were good points on both sides, but the majority of responses were from closet interface haters succumbing to the mob effect to say &ldquo;me too&rdquo;. On the other side of the argument, many took cover behind regurgitated responses like interfaces are for mocking dependencies in unit tests and because people that write books say you should use them. So how is it that scores of professional software developers don’t understand or can’t communicate why and how to use the most fundamental of object-oriented language features? Perhaps there is a clue in the details of the original question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there some hidden benefit of using an interface when you have 1 version of a class and no immediate need to create an interface?</p></blockquote>

<p>The scattered and ineffectual responses are an unfortunate casualty of the ubiquitous poor online examples found on the Internet. No doubt you’ve seen something like this before:</p>

<p>I can’t help but have visions of rich objects that model the physical world so well they put an end to wars and world hunger. You know, methods like <code>Bark()</code> on a <code>Dog</code> object. These examples aren’t wrong per se, but they usher the reader down a predictable and dead-end path. It’s like the horribly cliché <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box">nine dots puzzle</a> in which the goal is to link all 9 dots using four straight lines or less, without lifting the pen.</p>

<p>Common sense suggests it can’t be done because we have subconsciously imposed a false restriction that the lines must be within the boundaries of the square (I won’t insult you with the hopelessly worn out catch phrase). The point I’m trying to make here is the examples out there unwittingly set us up for failure. In social science this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences">framing</a>. The human brain is an impressive problem solving machine, but we can be easily fooled by framing a problem in a way that our stereotypes and assumptions obscure the often obvious answer.</p>

<p>In the case of interfaces, the examples suggest the concrete implementations are mutually exclusive physical concepts like <em>Car</em> and <em>Bus</em>, or perhaps <code>SqlUserStore</code> and <code>LdapUserStore</code>. It’s an easy concept to latch on to, and it’s the bane of good object oriented design.</p>

<p>To think of a user store as a thing is a mistake. <code>IUserStore</code> defines a seam in which responsibility crosses a boundary. In an MVC application, it’s the seam between the controller’s routing responsibility and the model’s business logic. If you only have one implementation of <code>IUserStore</code>, then you’d better take another look because that’s a smell.</p>

<p>The place to start looking is within your one and only implementation. Where is the logic about sending a confirmation email or checking if the username is available? Chances are it ended up in the controller leaving your model anemic or it ended up in your model violating the single responsibility principle. Either way it’s a big fail sandwich.</p>

<p>Again, this is because of the false assumption that implementations are mutually exclusive as in the <em>Car</em> and <em>Bus</em> example. In other words, if I have a <em>Car</em>, then I don’t have a <em>Bus</em>. This is the wrong way to think of objects. Of course they can be mutually exclusive, but they are far more powerful when they are composable. Consider these implementations of <code>IUserService</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EmailConfirmationUserService</code></li>
<li><code>ValidatingUserService</code></li>
<li><code>SqlUserService</code></li>
<li><code>CachingUserService</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Each concern is orthogonal to each other concern and they are combined together to create the overall behavior of the system. The interface facilitates composition which is the key to high-quality, robust software. So the real problem isn’t that interfaces are overused, it’s that interfaces are squandered.</p>
