  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>If you don’t know where you are going, you will wind up somewhere else. – Yogi Berra</p></blockquote>

<p>When asked how a project is going, most programmers will offer one of two discreet responses. It’s either “I just started looking at the code” or “I’m done, I just need to clean up a few things.” Upon further investigation, I have found that done means the hard part has been figured out and there is usually an IDE output window or a funky test web page running on localhost that can demonstrate this status.</p>

<p>The problem is that the hard part is really the fun part, and the actual hart part is the “…I just need to clean up a few things.” So, to remind me and the rest of the team what done means, we have the following definition posted prominently on the wall.</p>

<h3>1) Unit Tested</h3>

<p>This doesn’t need much of an explanation, but having a formal definition posted on the wall is a good reminder for a team new to unit testing.</p>

<p>Unit testing by itself is important, but the real boost comes from using a CI server. We use TeamCity for our .NET projects and phpUnderControl for php projects.</p>

<h3>2) Acceptance Tested</h3>

<p>For our team, acceptance testing means that we deploy our new code to a demo server and write Selenium tests for it. We export the selenium tests as phpUnit fixtures that CruiseControl will run whenever our svn repository is updated. Before the selenium tests are run, we need to update our demo server, so we have CruiseControl call <code>http://ourdemoserver.com/svn-update.php</code> first.</p>

<h3>3) Packaged For Deployment</h3>

<p>For our .NET projects, we use a homegrown tool for packaging and deploying. It can stop/start IIS register/unregister COM+ objects and rollback across a farm. For php projects, we simply hand roll a zip file and use some lightweight scripts to unpack the files on the server with rollback ability.</p>

<h3>4) No Increased Technical Debt</h3>

<p>I ask myself if this code is going to be an asset that makes us stronger and able to respond more quickly to future business opportunities, or is it going to be a fragile liability that I will need to carefully tip-toe around 30 seconds after it’s deployed.</p>

<p>Just like a parent thinks their kid is the cutest kid ever, it can be hard to look at your own work when you’ve got your head wrapped around it and come to terms with the fact that you’re about to deploy some legacy code. I usually grab a coworker and walk through things while paying close attention to the <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">only valid measurement of code quality</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend of mine, Keith, used the term martinizing (as in <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Uncle Bob</a>) for the process of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">cleaning code</a>. The term has taken on a very specific meaning and it’s worth a few words.</p>

<p>Martinizing is similar to refactoring in that it does not change the observable behavior of the code, but the goal is different. When I refactor, I am changing the design, usually in an effort to add a new feature in an <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OpenClosedPrinciple">open closed</a> manner.</p>

<p>When I martinize, I am telling a story. The most important story being the desired behavior, but also a story of the hard earned knowledge acquired along the way. If I spend hours distilling some business concept. I want to leave a trail for the next guy to understand that a simple property assignment or conditional statement isn’t so simple. And of course the perfect way to punctuate that message is with a well written unit test.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/homer-donut-thumb.jpg"></p>

<p>I must warn you, this post is about unit testing software, not donuts. With that said, I’ve been pondering the dilemma of how much time to spend writing unit tests and today I had a moment of clarity that I couldn’t help but share.</p>

<p>I was pairing with a coworker on Friday and we were both feeling a bit unproductive because we had spent so much time writing unit tests for a relatively small bit of code. In fact we spent more time writing tests than we spent writing the code to make the tests pass. To make matters worse, we spent more time refactoring the unit tests than we did refactoring the code that made the tests pass. We were pining over the readability of the tests as if the test were more important than the code and that left me with an uneasy feeling over the weekend.</p>

<p>Today I found a bit of inner peace as I embraced the the notion that the tests are more important than the code that makes them pass. Think about that for a moment. The challenge in writing software is not the implementation. Syntax, structures and algorithms are the easy parts. The real hard earned knowledge won through experience comes in the form of specifications; Understanding the intricate complexities and desired behavior of your software in the wild.</p>

<p>Writing software can be like swimming in the ocean when a thick fog rolls in. The mechanics of swimming are learned easily, but the real challenge is knowing which direction to swim so that you get back to the shore before you run out of energy. After a day of programming, the real asset is not the implementation of your feature, it’ s the increased understanding of your problem domain. This understanding is captured in the form of executable requirements.</p>

<p>When there is a bug in your system, chances are it’s a bug in your understanding of how your system should behave under a particular set of conditions. Burying an innocuous if statement in the middle of some method deep in the stack is a horrible way to reap the reward of day spent spelunking through code. It’s like eating a donut on the way home from the gym.</p>

<p>The legacy you leave is the the unit test, it tells the story of the hard fought knowledge and the readability of your test is more important than the readability of your implementation. Tell the next developer what’s important through an executable specification that reads like one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="plain" src="/images/posts/shoes.jpg"></p>

<p>The only hard part is convincing your boss that it’s not a colossal waste of time, right? Well that’s the first hurdle and yes it’s a doosie, but it’s just the price of admission. The real fun starts when you sit next to your partner and try to prove your boss wrong. After a year or so in the trenches, I’ve learned a thing or two on how to mess it up.</p>

<h3>5. Researching new technology</h3>

<p>“Click on that link, no wait scroll up, over there, wait I wasn’t done reading that…” That’s not pair programming, that’s insanity. Recently we were working on a project that involved a custom Firefox browser skin. Neither of us had experience with browser skins, so there was a lot of Googling and tutorial reading. As soon as we caught ourselves reading blogs and whatnot, we would split up for 15 minutes and then compare notes.</p>

<h3>4. Getting your environment going</h3>

<p>“Hey buddy, are you ready to start pairing on that project? Let’s see, now where is the source code for the project we’re working on… Hmm, this doesn’t compile – I think I need to install the latest version of that library.” Kill me now.</p>

<h3>3. Paralysis</h3>

<p><img class="plain right" src="/images/posts/FrightenedMan400.jpg"></p>

<p>One of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut would write clever things like “The man looked… guilty isn’t the right word, but it’s the first one that comes to mind.”</p>

<p>With pair programming, you can’t just sit there because you don’t know where to start or you can’t think of the right variable name. Just type something. You have to get the problem solving out of your head and into a medium that two people can have a conversation about it. Maybe people are afraid to type something in front of a peer if it’s not perfect. Borrow a technique from Kurt Vonnegut and as you are type, just say “I don’t want the code to look like this…” and write some awful switch case statement.</p>

<p>Once there is something on the screen, you and your partner are instantly aligned and solving the same problem. Now you can discuss factories and polymorphism and all kinds of heady solutions.</p>

<h3>2. Not doing TDD</h3>

<p>Have you ever watched an artist paint a picture and thought to yourself “what the heck is that”. Then with the next brush stroke you realize you’re looking at the profile of someone’s face. Well watching someone write code can be horribly worse than that.</p>

<p>Pair programming is a conversation, not a seminar or window into someone’s brain. The best way to keep things at a conversational level is to work top down which is exactly what TDD forces you to do. You must consider your code from the client perspective and challenge yourself to keep your code on purpose.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, TDD gives you and your buddy an “out” at regular intervals. You write a test, you make a test pass. Either way, you have many small victories over the course of a few hours and you can switch pairs at well defined feel-good stopping points.</p>

<h3>1. Not using a timer</h3>

<p><img class="plain left" src="/images/posts/pprobot.jpg"></p>

<p>I used to work with a guy that was always competing with something. A mutual friend at the office was doing the 3-day breast cancer walk. If anyone in the office donated money, he would up his donation $1 higher. On the softball team, his jersey number was #1. When we started playing ping-pong at lunch, he bought a $600 ping-pong robot to practice with at home. So when he started using a timer while programming I just figured it was good old Paul racing against time.</p>

<p>Then I paired with him on a project. Right after wanting to strangle him for not having his environment ready, we set his timer for 30 minutes and got going. When the timer went off, we stopped mid keystroke and switched seats. This did a few things. First, it kept Paul engaged the whole time because he knew he would be in the hot seat in a few minutes, and I can be a bit of a bully so it was easier for me to back off knowing I’d get my chance soon enough. One of the more surprising benefits, however, was simply the fact that we would sit for a minute and agree exactly what we were doing before starting the timer which really got us in gear and drastically cut down on tangents.</p>

<p>Using a timer creates a magical dynamic that I cannot do justice with words. It’s like TDD, it’s not about the tests – it’s about the code you write to make it testable. You have to try it. Period.</p>
