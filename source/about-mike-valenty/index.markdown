I’m a software developer in San Diego, CA. A few years ago I had a mid-life programming crisis and went on a rampage reading books, blogs, watching videos and lots of trial and error. I’ll let you know when I figure it all out. Until then, this blog is an ongoing account of the process. Since it’s a technical blog, I wont write about my family and other fun stuff like hockey, surfing, mountain biking and backpacking.
